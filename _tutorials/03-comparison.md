title:  "Comparing simulations and building blocks in PK-Sim® and MoBi®"
description: >
  This tutorial presents how to compare two simulations of the same molecule with
  respect to their input parameter values and quickly determine differences. Also learn how to
  determine which simulation parameter values may differ from the original building block used
  to create the simulation.
